# Getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-project

CodeBook.md describes how to use all of the variables, data, and any transformations or work done to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. Remember to follow instructions in the CodeBook.md

Merge the training and test sets to create a dataset.
Extract only the mean and standard deviation of the measurements for each measure.
Name the activities in the dataset using descriptive activity names
Appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
From the dataset in step 4, create a second, separate tidy dataset containing the mean of each variable for each activity and each topic.

The code will output the final tidy dataset as tidySet.txt
